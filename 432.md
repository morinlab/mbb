Specific topics include innate immune responses, including the function of innate immune cells, receptors and complement, and adaptive immune responses, including the organization of lymphoid organs, development and function of T and B cells, and antibodies.  The impact of the immunological processes discussed on human health will also be discussed, with a focus on how vaccines work. 

## Topics

* Innate immune responses – Immediate responses to infections
* Innate immune responses – Induced responses to infections
* Antibody structure and development
* B cell development
* T cell receptor structure and development
* Antigen presentation to T cells
* T cell development
* T cell activation and clearance of pathogens
* B cell activation and effector functions of antibodies
* Immune memory and vaccination

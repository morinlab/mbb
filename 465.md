# CANCER GENOMICS

## Overview
An examination of the genomic changes that accrue during the formation and treatment of human cancer.

The course will examine the role that genetic mutations play in the development of human cancer and tumour formation. We will study the spectrum of different types of genetic alterations that accrue and their distribution across different cancer types.   We will study the technologies that allow these changes to be detected and how they are interpreted clinically. Students with credit for MBB 460 under the title "Cancer Genomics" may not take this course for further credit.
